Validation-running callback.

This is the one callback that EMITS events as well as consuming them: 
runs the validation pass, then broadcasts ``on_validation_end`` to every callback on the
context. Keeps the orchestrator out of the validation business entirely --
it doesn't know a validation set exists -- while MetricsRecorder, MetricsPlotter
and GeometryVisualizer all react to validation exactly as they react to a step.
