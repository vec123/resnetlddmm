class ResamplingGraphLoader:
    """Rebuilds the encoder graph from raw geometry each step with a fresh rng.

    Graph construction is delegated to a ``GraphBuilder`` strategy
    (src/learning/data/builders.py): the loader calls
    ``builder.build(verts, mask, rng, areas=..., normals=...)`` and knows nothing
    about radii, dropout, or supernodes -- that policy lives on the ``GraphSpec``
    the builder was constructed with. Swapping radius-graph for kNN construction is
    now "pass a different ``GraphBuilder``", not a change to this class.

    ``vertices`` / ``mask`` / ``areas`` / ``normals`` are direct arguments: they are
    the loader's fixed per-shape geometry (parallel arrays, indexed identically), not a
    construction choice, so they don't belong on the builder/spec.

    The ``rng`` generator's state advances as it is consumed, giving a different graph
    each step while staying reproducible from the seed.

    ``two_view`` makes the contrastive path OPTIONAL: when False (default) each step
    yields the ordinary single-view ``(graph, super, true_verts, mask)`` four-tuple; when
    True it draws TWO independent graphs (different vertex dropout / sampling) of the same
    shapes and yields ``(graph_a, super_a, true_verts, mask, graph_b, super_b)`` -- view A
    in the first four slots so the logger (which reads ``batch[:4]``) is unaffected. The
    six-tuple is what ``TrainingStepper.train_step`` turns into a "same shape -> same
    encoding" alignment loss.

    ``batch_size`` selects mini-batching over SHAPES (dim 0 of ``vertices``): when set and
    smaller than the dataset, each step draws a fresh random subset of that many shapes and
    builds the graph from only those. The yielded ``true_verts`` / ``mask`` are sliced to
    the SAME subset so the decoder's reconstruction target matches the encoder's input; in
    ``two_view`` mode both views use the same subset. ``None`` (default) keeps the original
    full-batch behaviour (every shape, every step).
