        """Frame axes from the pooled SECOND moment M = sum_i w_i sum_c v_ic v_ic^T.

        Why a second moment: M is PSD, so nothing cancels. The first moment
        sum_i w_i v_i is a quadrature of an integral that very nearly vanishes over a
        closed surface (cf. int_S n dA = 0), which leaves the frame to be built out of
        the cancellation residual -- measured at ~1% of the per-node vector norms, and
        *smaller* the more faithfully the surface is integrated. A second moment has no
        such symmetry, so a uniform gate is no longer fatal.

        Equivariance: M -> R M R^T under x -> Rx, so its eigenvectors carry over as
        u -> ±Ru. ``eigh`` picks that SIGN arbitrarily, which would break equivariance
        outright, so it is fixed here by the third moment of the projections,
        sum_i w_i (u . v_i)^3: each (u . v_i) is invariant, and flipping u flips the
        statistic, so requiring it >= 0 is a canonical and equivariant choice. (It is
        the one thing that can still go ambiguous -- on a shape whose projections are
        symmetric the statistic vanishes, exactly the configurations that have no
        canonical frame to begin with.)

        Returns two ORTHONORMAL axes (the two leading eigenvectors), so the Gram-Schmidt
        downstream is well-conditioned and the near-zero-norm guard cannot trip. The
        cost is ``eigh``, whose gradient carries 1/(lambda_i - lambda_j) terms: nearly
        degenerate eigenvalues (a shape with no distinguished axis) make it stiff.
