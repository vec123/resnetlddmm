    Fixes the pose/deformation GAUGE. The data term only ever sees the product
    ``phi(T) @ R_hat``, so for any rotation A the pair ``(phi(T)@A, A^-1 @ R_hat)``
    predicts exactly the same points -- a 3-parameter family of equally optimal
    answers, of which training picks one arbitrarily. The symptom is
    ``pose_supervision_loss`` pinned at ``||A^-1 - I||_F^2`` (~6 for a random A, since
    R_aug cancels out of that expression) while the data term falls happily.

    This is the only term that can see the split, because it looks at ``phi(T)``
    alone rather than at the product. Driving R_flow to identity selects A = I, which
    means the deformation performs no net rotation and R_hat carries the whole pose --
    the factorisation implied by "the template defines the canonical frame".

    Correspondence, which Procrustes needs, holds STRUCTURALLY here: the integrator is
    elementwise, so ``phi(T)[i]`` is by construction the image of ``T[i]``. (Between
    the deformed template and a SAMPLE it would not hold, which is a different and
    much less safe use of the same algorithm.)

    Translation is not penalised: Procrustes mean-centres both clouds, and a net
    translation of the flow is genuinely needed to match shapes whose centroids
    differ -- it is not gauge, because R_hat cannot absorb it.

    Weighting: the data term is EXACTLY flat along the gauge, so any weight > 0
    selects A = I with nothing opposing it; the weight only sets how fast. Keep it
    small so it stays a tie-breaker. Genuine articulated motion, whose net Procrustes
    rotation is not pose, sits on a CURVED direction and is biased by a factor
    ``D'' / (D'' + 4w)`` -- negligible while ``w << D''/4``. The empirical check is to
    raise the weight 10x: if the data term does not move, the penalty is acting only
    on flat directions and cannot be distorting geometry.

    This is the only pose signal here that is genuinely supervised. It needs no
    vertex correspondence, cannot be satisfied by collapsing anything, and does not
    depend on the flow being any good — which is what lets the pose head and the
    field train at the same time instead of waiting on each other. Chamfer, by
    contrast, reaches the pose head through a nearest-neighbour assignment that
