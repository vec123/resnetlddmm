        The rotation is TRANSPOSED relative to what GroupEncoder returns, and that
        transpose is load-bearing rather than cosmetic.

        GroupEncoder builds its rotation by Gram-Schmidt from type-1 (vector)
        features, so it is equivariant as ``R(x·Q) = Qᵀ·R(x)`` — identically, for
        every weight setting, since this is a property of the e3nn construction and
        not something training selects. But poses are applied downstream as
        ``points @ R`` (mapping_error._apply_encoder_pose, matching SE3_transform),
        which needs the opposite handedness: ``P(x·Q) = P(x)·Q``.

        Those two cannot be reconciled by learning. Requiring both gives
        ``Qᵀ A = A Q`` for all Q, i.e. ``Qᵀ = A Q A⁻¹`` — inversion is an
        ANTI-automorphism while conjugation is an automorphism, and on a non-abelian
        group such as SO(3) no such A exists. Left as-is, the pose objective is not
        merely hard to optimise, it is unsatisfiable, and the pose head sits at
        chance forever.

        Transposing fixes it exactly: ``P := Rᵀ`` gives
        ``P(x·Q) = (Qᵀ R(x))ᵀ = R(x)ᵀ Q = P(x)·Q``.

        A side effect worth having: the returned rotation is now directly comparable
        with the element an augmentation drew (SE3_transform uses the same ``x @ R``
        convention), which is what makes pose supervision meaningful.
