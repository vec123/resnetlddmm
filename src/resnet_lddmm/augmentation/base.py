    """Strategy for applying random group transformations to source point clouds.

    Before the source points enter the neural ODE flow, an optional augmentation
    step can apply a random group element (rotation, rotation+translation) to
    each shape in the batch. The template remains fixed in canonical space.

    This is used as data augmentation: the flow learns to handle shapes at
    various random poses, encouraging pose-invariant learned deformations.

    Semantics:
    - Source points [B, N, 3] → (optionally transformed) → flow
    - Template points [M, 3] → (unchanged) canonical space
    - Gradients flow: loss → augmented_points → transformation → flow params
